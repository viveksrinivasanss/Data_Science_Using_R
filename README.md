# Data_Science_Using_R
Hola Fellow Data Science Enthusiast,

This series is intended for data science beginners who wanted to have quick introduction to data science using R. It covers basics of R to advance concepts in statistics and machine learning.

Whenever someone wants to start a career in data science. We have vast number of online resources available. But most of the contents are bits and pieces in nature. This series is intended to give comprehensive introduction to all basic topics in statistics and machine learning using R.

The contents are inspired from couple of books which I got introduced during my IIM-B days.
* R for Everyone - Jared P. Lander
* Practical Data Science with R - Nina Zumel & John Mount

This series is for those who need quick introduction to statistics and machine learning using R. All codes and data used in the series are available in the repository.

Hope it helps and happy learning !!!!!!!!!!
